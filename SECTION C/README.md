## Section C: Code Challenge
## Option 1: Say the Number - Python

## How does it work?

   This project works with Python. It is executed using the 'main.py' file. The other file is a test for the main function. Simply call the function, within a print function while inserting any number for the parameter. I also made use of one main class to make the code easy to follow.

## What is the goal of this function?

To take an integer as a paramater and return it in it's respective word-format. I did not use a package/ dependecy as I thought part of the challenge was to find ways to solve the issue.

## How to Develop, Use, and Test the code.
   Firstly, you will need to install an IDE/ IDLE that can run .py files, such as PyCharm. (If you don't have one installed.) Once you have the IDE/ IDLE setup, then run the 'main.java' file. This is the main-driver file for running the program. When the file has been opened, then run / execute the program.

Now that you have the program running, you will see print statements in the main method. Change the numbers in the num_to_word function to obtain different results.

To test the code, you can apply the same logic as above to the 'test_main.py' file.

(NB: When installing PyCharm, make sure you install the correct package for your operating system e.g Windows. The use of PyCharm is universal.)
