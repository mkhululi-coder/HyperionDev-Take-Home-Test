## Worst-Case Space Complexity
The worst-case Space Complexity for my solution is: O(1).
This program follows a constant sequence.

The reason for this conclusion is that the time difference that could occur in the if/ if-else statements are so minor and does not drastically increase with more input. This makes the increase constant, thus giving us a Space Complexity of O(1).

There are no loops, and the if/ if-else statements have basic functionality.

## Side Note
It is true that if-statements can be of type O(n) or more, but this is if they have complex functionality like loops for sorting.
